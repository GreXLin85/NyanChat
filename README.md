Really Cute And Secure Chat

# What you need

 - A server
 - 2 clients
# Setup
 - open console and write `npm i` command 

> this is for installing ui and server dependencies

 - after all the dependencies are installed write `cd react-ui` command
 - and write again `yarn add`

> these two commands for installing  front-end dependencies

# Usage
 - open the chat server  `yarn start-server`
 - open the react server `cd react-ui` > `yarn start`
 - open app `cd ..` > `yarn start-ui`
(and the person you will chat with should do the same steps)
